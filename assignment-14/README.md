How did your user testing sessions go?

The tests went as expected and more. I had some ideas on what should be changed prior to having people check out the site's previous format, but it was fun to hear what could stay. I was surpised to hear on different aspects from the two testers of certain things that they liked about the page, such as the hover block text. I revieved constructive ideas that I definally want to incorperate into my site.

What changes (if any) did you make to your website based on the user feedback you received?

I wanted to gut out the previous design aspects of the site, It felt cluttered, and I want it to look more cool. Therefore I went with darker tones and I wanted to change the layout of the pages attached to the home page. I changed the design aspects of the site, some pages are still in the works. I certaintly want to mess around more with the design layout.

Optional: What challenges did you face this week, and how did you overcome them?
