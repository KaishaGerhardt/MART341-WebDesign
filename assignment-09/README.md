Briefly recap your experience learning HTML. What was old, new, interesting, or difficult to learn?

I have coding experience and so HTML isn't too unfamiliar. However, I wasn't confident in it due to having a year gap between coding classes. I was a little nervous jumping back into HTML but it's been a lot smoother than I expected and I now thoroughly enjoy working with HTML! It could be because of taking coding courses previously but things began clicking when starting this course. I now better understand website creation and the code that goes along with them.
