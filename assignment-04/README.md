Very briefly detail how browsers function. List any browsers you currently use to surf - or even develop for - the web.

Web Browsers are programs that offer access to the internet from  electrocnic devices. Web browsers are created in programable languages such as HTML, Javascipt and CSS. The browsers read the coding language and create the format of what the language has constructed to have images, text and other content be assorted as. Examples of browsers that I personally use is: Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge.
