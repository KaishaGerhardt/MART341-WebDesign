 In the responses.txt file, please answer the following questions:


What is a directory, and what is its relationship to files?

	A directory is a hierarchical structural way of organization in relation to digital file systems, in other words, its a "folder".

How are VCS useful?

	Version control systems allow changes in the file to be tracked, along with making collaborations easier because the changes are tacked making the work that is done
visible and accessible to others.

Do you have a favorite artistic medium? Why is it your favorite?
	
	I personally don't have a favorite medium yet that I work with. I try to mix back and forth between fine and digital art-making. However, a medium that is one of my
favorites for viewing, would be marble sculptures. I am amazed by the abilities of artists who can make stone into such soft-looking material. Greek statues show the intricate
details like indents on the skin or the crinkle of fabric, which is just jaw-dropping to me.
