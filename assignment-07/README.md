Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do they serve?

I've seen forms be used as a way of gathering information from the viewers. It creates an optionial tactic for users to express, receive and give information, such as feedback or questions. Forms allow data to be sent into a server for processing and the most common form to be found is "user logins".
