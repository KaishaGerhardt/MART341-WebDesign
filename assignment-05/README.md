Tell me about a website you visited using The Wayback Machine. What year was it from? How is the older version different from the new version in terms of its overall design?

I visited Amazon.com in the year 2005. The design layout has been substantially adapted since then. Today, the website is more filled with images rather than text.
In the older version, the site is very text heavy and has more information located on the sides of the site. Whereas, today's site is more centered and avoids large amounts of text.
The newer design is overall more visually appealing and simplified compared to the 2005 version.
