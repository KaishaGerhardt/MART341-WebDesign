Describe the difference between the universal, element, class, and id selector types. When might you choose one over the other to style content?

Universal selector is to be used for styling every element on a page, while elements are applied to a certain aspect. The class selectors are used to select elements that carry the same function. and lastly, the ID selectors makes define style rules for elements. These range in use on how much an area will be stylized and what wants explicitly to have an alternate stylization.

Discuss your color palette. How did you choose your colors?

I currently have Vincent van Gogh's "Almond Blossom" set as my background for my laptop and it is one of my favorite pieces created by him. I drew inspiration from it and was curious about its color palette. I used the adobe color wheel and I moved the dropper around to get the distinct colors I enjoyed about it.
